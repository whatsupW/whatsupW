It is impossible not to notice the changes that took place on February 24, 2022. 
On February 24, 2022 at 3.45 am, Vladimir Putin gave the order to carry out a "special military operation in Ukraine". According to the president of Russia, he had to help the citizens of Ukraine and protect them. Attacking in the morning when everyone was asleep, without notice. Does this movement remind you of something? Didn't Hitler act like that on September 1, 1939 in Poland? Isn't this movement Nazi? Is this what the help should look like?

The explosions were heard in the morning on the outskirts of Kiev, in Kharkiv, but also, among others, in the Lviv region in the west of Ukraine. However, it soon turned out that both military infrastructure and civilian facilities were under attack. He sent recruited young soldiers who he made convinced that these were exercises. He sent them like cannon fodder. No experience, no provisions or old tanks. It was only when the young Russians realized that they were attacking.

Putin's troops are bombing cities. Not looking at the civilian population. Kindergartens, schools and even hospitals are bombed. 

In Lugansk, the Russian army seized the hospital that the Ukrainians were trying to recover. Putin was able to make propaganda out of this, showing that it was the Ukrainian troops firing at their own hospital. This is what kindergartens look like now.

And this is what everyday life looks like.

President Zelensky asked for humanitarian corridors and a ceasefire so that the population could evacuate. Guess what putin did? He ordered civilians to be shot. This is genocide.

And what is shown in the Russian media that they are liberating Ukraine, that the Ukrainians are thanking for the liberation. All of this is not true.

See how they prepared the film to show that Putin is not hiding.

The whole world rebelled, and what does the Russian citizen see? What Putin serves on a tray. In Mariupol, civilians come out and face the oncoming tanks. Without weapons, they can stop a tank! They are not afraid to die. For what, that is death in the face of the INDEPENDENCE OF THE COUNTRY.

The defenseless inhabitants of Enerhodar block the road to the nuclear power plant from the army of the terrorist state - the Russian federation. Upd. Shootings, grenade blasts, there are casualties.

You are being fed propaganda movies. Why there is no independent media. Why are websites that show the truth blocked. Unfortunately, the president of Russia has a lot of control over what will be broadcast and communicated, people are ignorant. You, Russian citizen, live in ignorance. Vladimir Putin does not save Ukrainian citizens, civilians and children are dying. The military operation will end in the murder of civilians.

On March 11, 2022, the Putin government wants to turn off the global internet for you. From that day on, he will completely control your life.

Do not be indifferent. Many people have already gone out to protest. Belarus: Despite the constant repression in the country ruled by Alexander Lukashenka since the summer of 2020, Belarusians have taken to the streets again. This time, at the appeal of the leader of the democratic opposition, Swiatlana Cichanouska, who was staying in Vilnius, thousands of people protested in Minsk against the Russian aggression in Ukraine. People lined up in long lines in front of the polling stations, not to vote, but to shout "Niet war!" And "Glory to Ukraine!". Old men, children, mothers of soldiers. Russians and Belarusians are protesting against the war despite repression.

It's just a drop in the ocean. Not only Belarus, but many other countries make Russians realize how wrong their president is. Don't go out alone. Take a friend, friend. There is strength in unity. Then start protesting. Let this protest not only be an objection to the war in Ukraine, but also an objection to Putin's rule. Let it be for freedom of speech and democracy.
